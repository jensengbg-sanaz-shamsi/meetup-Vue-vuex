### about the project
It was very goos to work with vue-vuex again. Unfortunately, we have not worked with vue (after vue course) so much and because it is a new field for us ,it took an extra long time to create project (first version 3 and i couldn´t work with it, again make a new project with vue version2) and I have done google many times .

TDD - I think this is important area. we have learned in this course.
However, I find it a bit difficult with testing, especially now that I run testing via vuex ,at first i had no clue,but after some googling I could done some tests,but as you can see in SignUp.spec.js i had many problems and i couldn´t fix it with "spyOn", so i leave it.I think in future i will skip TDD from my skills:)

Docker&Herkou- during the sessions video,i thought docker and heroku must be difficult but it was the easiest part of my project and i enjoy to do that.
